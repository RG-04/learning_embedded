# Learning Embedded (?) and other Stuff

- This repository contains my attempt at learning about embedded systems and computer architecture, starting right up from what the boot process looks like.
- A lot of the content (at least initially) contains references and learnings from articles written by [Uros Popovic](https://popovicu.com/).
- Each folder contains its own `README.md` file which holds running instructions and more importantly, a brief summary of what I have learned from it. 
- Some installation instructions (like setting up QEMU, installing OpenSBI) may be missing. This is intentional, as the aim of this repository is not to compile all the sources, but to simply provide a quick summary
